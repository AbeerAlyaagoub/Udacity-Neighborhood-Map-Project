# Udacity FEND - Neighborhood Map Project

## Project Overview:
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


## App Features
- fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.


## App Architecture
Code is properly separated based upon Knockout best practices (follow an MVVM pattern, avoid updating the DOM manually with jQuery or JS, use observables rather than forcing refreshes manually, etc). Knockout should not be used to handle the Google Map API.


## Tools
- [Knouckout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
- [Foursquare's API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/getting-started)


## How to run the application 
Clone the repo and open up `index.html` in your browser to launch the app. Enjoy!
